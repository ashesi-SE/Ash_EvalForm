Ash_EvalForm -- A virtual evaluation form where evaluators can grade teams
============

Ash_EvalForm is a virtual form that allows clients to grade and give constructive feedback to students during presentation of their projects. This allows multiple evaluators to fill a feedback and evaluation form for teams, consequently these teams in turn can review the numeric feedback and comments as well as the tabulated results of these multiple evaluators.

Problem Generation
====================
Scenario Name: Ash-Virtual-Form 

Problem Identified
==================
Students are not able to view their evaluation sheet and averaged results conveniently.
Teams are only able to briefly review their feedback before results are tabulated electronically.
Lecturers or faculty interns have to manually tabulate and find the average of the results.
Evaluators have to assess teams manually and as a result there is a lot of paper generated.

Payoff
======
The virtual evaluation form allows:
Students to view their evaluation sheet conveniently.
Evaluators to have their ratings collated automatically by the system for teams.
Evaluators to assess teams either electronically or manually.
Faculty interns to have a simple way to generate a spreadsheet based on team criteria.
